# Welcome! Michael Ball in CS184


_Full disclaimer:_
While I love CS194, this site is really mostly based off of my personal website at [http://michaelballphoto.com](http://michaelballphoto.com). Feel free to poke around there, or the other pages of this site. You can also find a mirror of this website on [Github](http://cycomachead.github.io/comp-photo-class)

The best way to email me, is to use the address: ball@berkeley.edu.
<br />
(There's no point in obfuscating them as it's super easy to circumvent.)

Anyway, if you're so inclined, you can see an older image of me on my [about page](about). Or you can use this more recent image and figure out who Michael is in the photo! ![DailyCal Photo](images/michael-michael.jpg)

P.S. Apologizes that I have yet to (properly) compress the header photo.
