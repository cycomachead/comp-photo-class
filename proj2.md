## Building a Pinhole Camera

## Camera Obscura
Our camera obscura was manufactured from a 5"x11"x14" cardboard box. We used black construction paper to cover all of the inside walls but one, and white printer paper to cover the remaining wall. We cut two holes in the wall opposite the white paper: one to mount the aperture tile, and one to insert the camera, a Canon Powershot G10. We positioned the camera upside down to capture the image right side up. To create the aperture tiles, we took advantage of the CITRIS Invention Lab equipment by laser cutting apertures with three diameters: 0.1 mm, 1 mm, and 5 mm in squares of blue acrylic. We used black duct tape to tape the construction paper and the outside of the box and white gaffer tape to attach the white screen paper.

We chose to capture photographs of two classic Berkeley campus landmarks: the Sather Tower and the Doe Library. We successfully captured the scenes with the 5mm and the 1mm aperture. To capture the shots, we set ISO to its highest setting of 1600 and varied the shutter speed to obtain optimal lighting. The shutter speeds that were chosen for each aperture and scene are listed below the photos. The 1mm aperture produced a more focused image, but optimizing the lighting was more difficult. We also experimented with Photoshop-free smart object editing technology by pasting in a marker-shaped blimp in the sky above the Campanile.

For the smallest aperture of 0.1 mm, we had difficulty getting an image. The camera we used initially could not be set to a shutter speed above 15 seconds. At that setting, the image was poorly lit and had a blue tint due to light diffusion from the acrylic aperture tile. The tile was also fairly thick, which limited the field of view. We tried using a better camera, but it had a much wider lens and could not fit in our box. We experimented with a tripod and novel sweater-based light shield technology (see Setup), but still did not get a good result.

### Additional Images
All additional images were taken with aperture of 1 mm, since that gave us the best focus. We took them later in the day, so we used the shutter speed of 15 seconds, but they were still slightly dark.

For our macro photography, we set our box in a planter.

We lasercut our apertures.

Sometimes it became complicated to use the larger DSLR to make photos.

### Camera Camera Obscura (Pinhole camera in a room)

We created a camera obscura in a room by taping a "blackout" curtain over a window and cutting a small hole in the middle of it. All doors had to be covered and taped as well. A sheet was hung on the wall opposite the window to capture the view, which was then photographed. The resulting image and the pictures of the setup are below.

* Shutter speed = 3.2 seconds

### Painting with light
We painted with light using both a digital camera and our camera obscura. Here are the results.

### Stereo Cam

We added a second pinhole and some snazzy red and blue filters to make a stereo cam.  And what is a stereo image good for without the glasses to view it?
